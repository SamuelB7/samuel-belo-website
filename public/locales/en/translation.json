    "about_1": "In 2016 I graduated in Business Administration from PUC-PR and was working in a relatively stable job, however, I didn't feel professionally fulfilled, and honestly, I didn't like my job. Around 2019 I started to research other areas where I could fit in better and give myself the feeling of professional fulfillment I was looking for so much, that's when I saw in programming an opportunity to change careers. I've always been a very technical person, I really like to 'tweak' things, and use lines of code to solve problems, and be able to do this not only as a hobby but also as a job and build a career on top of it, that's what attracted me to the world of software engineering. I started my studies on my own through online courses, and in July 2021 I got my first job as a developer.",
    "about_2": "I've been working as a full-stack developer for a little over a year and I'm, again, at the beginning of my professional journey, but the difference is that now I work with something that makes me happy. I'll keep moving forward, always looking for continuous improvement.",
